PopUpGardens is an NSF funded collaboration between the <a href="http://jillahamilton.com/index.html">Hamilton</a>, Holliday, Keller, and Fitzpatrick labs. We are planting gardens of black cottonwood (_Populus trichocarpa_) balsam poplar (_Populus balsamifera_) and their hybrids across the United States from Louisiana to Washington to New Hampshire. Each garden will be planted with the same set of genetically identical individuals to study how genetic variation creates differences in physical, physiological, and developmental traits.
